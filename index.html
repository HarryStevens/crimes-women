				Police continued their search this weekend for Delhi assemblyman Somnath Bharti, who has <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/somnath-bharti-in-meerut-2-criminals-helping-him-cops/story-HdrmoYWWLBbSVk0uWEnkVI.html">successfully evaded arrest</a> after the Delhi high court on Tuesday <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/delhi-court-dismisses-somnath-bharti-s-anticipatory-bail-plea/story-shF4dAVsiI8kTsGL2DTW4I.html">refused to grant anticipatory bail</a> in a domestic violence case filed by his wife.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whether Barthi is ultimately found guilty of his alleged crimes, which also include <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-cases-to-be-heard-against-somnath-bharti-this-week/story-po6zGC5WN6eHqyXNWYjzkN.html">a molestation case filed by a group of African citizens last year</a>, the accusations highlight a growing trend in cases of violence against women nationwide.
			</p>

			<p>
				Last year, more than 329,000 crimes against women were reported across the country, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau. That represents a staggering 129 percent increase since 2001, when nearly 144,000 crimes against women were reported. It also represents a six percent jump from 2013, which saw nearly 310,000 crimes against women.

				There has been a nearly four-fold jump in kidnappings and abudctions since 2001. Violent crimes, including rapes, dowry deaths and assaults, have also seen dramatic increases.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even as public officials have expressed alarm, few have proposed effective measures to reverse the trend. An effort over the summer to ban pornography sites, in part justified by the rise in violence against women, was met with widespread skepticism and disapproval.</p>
